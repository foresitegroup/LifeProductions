      <h2>LEARN</h2>
      We meet with you to learn about you, your organization and business, taking special care to identify the objectives for your video presentation. We go over every aspect of the production and discuss all the ways you envision your video being used, the audience you are hoping to reach, the message you want to communicate and the type of emotion you want the video to evoke. We create a taping schedule that will work for you.

    <div class="process p2">
      <h2>PRODUCE</h2>
      Our production team works on site to capture the essence of the business, organization or individual we are displaying. Interviews are conducted in an unscripted and relaxed conversational manner to create a genuine story that is communicated effortlessly and with ease. We capture on site video footage of the organization, business or individual and incorporate key elements that will help support your story.

    <div class="process p3">
      <h2>EDIT</h2>
      In a timely and efficient manner we will edit your material and create a production piece that reflects the objectives that you have initially outlined. We celebrate your input making sure that we create a piece that you are happy with and schedule a post-production meeting so that we have your complete approval before we proceed with the packaging.
